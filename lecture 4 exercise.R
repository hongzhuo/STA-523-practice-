## Below is the list of primes between 2 and 100:
## 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 
## 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
## If you were given the vector 
## x = c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)
## write out the R code necessary to print only the values 
## of x that are not prime 
## (without using subsetting or the %in% operator).
## Your code should use nested loops to iterate 
## through the vector of primes and x
